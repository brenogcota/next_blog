In some cases it is interesting to show a default message in case there may be a **property** that does not exist in our locale object.
Imagine the following, you have two objects containing your translation keys, however, as mortals we end up forgetting some key,
so in this case, if a user tries to access in your language and this key is not in your object

```json
// pt-Br
{
  "key": "Alguma traducao aqui"
}
```

```json
// en-us
{
  "keyy": "same key, misspelled"
}
```

If you try to access this key there will be no return, so what would be a possible solution to this? ...**Proxy**

Let me show you an example:

**Proxy** is a way for you to observe when your object is called, and then take some action.

That way you can check if the object has a **property**, and if not, override the get method to pass a default value
